 On August 29, 2005 Hurricane Katrina proved to be a deadly and devastating storm, which unleashed it`s fury on the Gulf Coast area. The Park was unrecognizable. Buildings, units, homes, and all of the Parks infrastructure was completely destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.
  Cargo and merchandise that was, typically, stored at the City Port had been pushed ashore by the damaging hurricane. Containers filled with chicken and shrimp, trucks, tires, paper rolls, lumber, t-shirts, and all types of debris storms can conjure up was dumped into the Park.
  Luckily, every person residing in the Park, at that time, was accounted for and had not sustained injuries due to Hurricane Katrina.
