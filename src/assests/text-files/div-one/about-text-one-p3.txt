 On August 17, 1969 Hurricane Camille struck the Gulf Coast. Gulf Haven Motor Court and the Burns’ home were destroyed by the hurricane. Afterwards, the Burns’ obtained an SBA loan in order to rebuild their home and business.
  The business then became Burnsway Trailer Park, which the couple operated together until they both passed away.
