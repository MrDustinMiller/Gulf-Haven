FEMA was contacted regarding the site on which the Park had been located. Diane Burns Henderson and Adrian W. Burns convinced FEMA to utilize the property to house victims who had been left homeless because of the storm. FEMA was not charged rent for utilizing the
 property because they all had been left homeless. The Burnsâ€™ family felt the need to give something back to the community that had given them so much over the years.
