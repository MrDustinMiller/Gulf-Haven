FEMA agreed to the plan and laid the infrastructure to comply with all city and state codes. So, the wonderful property became a FEMA Park! Yes, Gulf Haven Campground is proud to have been a FEMA Park during a time that so many in the area needed a place to call home!
 During the time Gulf Haven Campground was used as a FEMA Park, there were no reported incidences of crime as was common among FEMA Parks during that transitional time. FEMA withdrew all of their units on November 1, 2007 at which time the property reverted back to private use.
