The property was updated with new RV hook-ups, pull-through spaces, Wi-Fi access and cable connection at every site, palm trees, flower beds, and much more! The office building was constructed which houses not only the office, but the showers and restrooms. A wraparound porch equipped
 with rocking chairs overlooks the beautiful Gulf of Mexico! During this period of change, a decision was made to revert back to the original name of Gulf Haven Campgroundâ€¦ Truly a first class RV Park!
